# Shared smart Environment Security (SES)
This project is for sharing IoT devices in samart environment where users set sharing policy for their the devices that they share.

The problem then is how we can select the most secure devices from the avialble shared devices such that we don't violate any shared policy. We attempt to formulat this problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. 


We test a toy example using `CP-SAT` model see [cp-sat1.py](./cp-sat1.py)
